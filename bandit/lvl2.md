# Level 2

To enter the third level, you need to ssh into the same server and port with the user bandit2 and the password obtained
in the [previous room](lvl1.md).

From the goal, we can see that the password is in a file called **spaces in this filename** in the home directory.
To read it, we use:

    $ cat 'spaces in this filename'

which prints:

    rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi
