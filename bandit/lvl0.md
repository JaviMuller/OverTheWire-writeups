# Level 0

This is the first level of the challenge, just ssh to bandit.labs.overthewire.org on port 2220 with the username
bandit0 and the password bandit0. For this, we can just do:

    $ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

and type the password bandit0.

You will be greeted and it says that the password is at file readme in the home directory.
The command:

    $ cat readme

returns:
