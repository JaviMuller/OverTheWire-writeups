# Level 1

To enter the second level, you need to ssh into the same server and port with the user bandit1 and the password obtained
in the [previous room](lvl0.md).

From the goal, we can see that the password is in a file called **-** in the home directory.
To read it, we use:

    $ cat ./-

which prints:

    rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi
